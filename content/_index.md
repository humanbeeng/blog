Welcome to my side of the internet. This is where I dump all my thoughts, learnings and observations. 

I've been coding from 2018'ish and never stopped since then. The joy of creating something out of thin air still leaves me in disbelief. Over the past few years I've written 
Go, Java, Kotlin(for Android), JS, TS as an hobbyist.

In 2021, I graduated from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering with a Computer Science degree. Currently working as a Senior Engineer at a fintech company 
where we provide business intelligence to financial institutions to make smart decisions when it comes to lending.

My passion for software engineering grew exponentially after watching [Silicon Valley, HBO](https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley)(100% recommend). I am obsessed with this idea of becoming a self sufficient 
person who can create whatever he can think of. I believe I'm on a right path to achieve this absurd goal.

Most of the time I'll be either working on a personal project of mine which attempts to solve the codesearch problem, or reading books to solidify my understanding of building and
maintaining scalable systems. Currently I'm reading

- [Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)

    I have a hard copy of this book. Completed first two chapters. I've decided to not read this book like a textbook, rather to read it like a reference material. Reading something without the 'why and when' is not
clicking with me. I'll go through the topic when I'm faced with a scenario which requires understanding of a particular topic covered in this book.

- [Foundations of Scalable Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/):

    Haven't started yet. I've heard good things about this book. Will give it a visit soon.
